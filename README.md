# Note Taker App

## Description

There are some people gifted with a great memory, however there are others that need to write things down in order to remember important information or activities to complete. Well this project is a note taking web application with the intention of having a place to keep track of your daily notes. This is a perfect way to stay organized and complete tasks during the day or week instead of keeping a mental note.

## Usage

You can have access to the web application by entering the following url to your browser: https://intense-woodland-89578-7cead3ecb04a.herokuapp.com/. You will be presented with the main page and can click on the `Get Started` button to navigate to the notes page. Your saved notes are posted on the left side of the page and once clicked the full note will be displayed to the right. You can click on the `+` sign that is placed on the top right of the webpage to add a new note. Once you type the new title note and note text, a `save icon` will be available on the top right of the page next to the plus sign. The `save icon` needs to be clicked in order for your note to be saved and transfered to the notes list on the left side. If you do not want to save the note, you can simply click on the `+` sign to clear the note and be able to enter a new note. Whenever you are done with a note, you have an option to delete them by clicking on the `trash icon` next to each note title.

## Credits

In order to have a unique id added to each new note, I installed the npm package [uuid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid).
